## What is a nopaste?

The term *nopaste* is a term used on the internet meaning to paste source code
to a separate, dedicated site, and to then link to that pasted source code in
forum discussions, chats, and so forth, instead of pasting that source code
directly. Many discussion forums and chat rooms don't have an option of
treating code in messages properly. Nopaste sites usually also offer syntax
highlighting, a history of code changes, commenting on lines of code and
similar.
