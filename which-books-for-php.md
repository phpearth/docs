There are many books available for learning PHP. But lots of them can get quickly oudated. Here is a quick list
of PHP books you should look into when learning PHP or extending your knowledge. Also keeping in mind that writing
a very good programming book can take several thousands hours so supporting their authors is nice way of saying
thank you.
