# Atom editor for PHP developers

!["Atom Editor"](https://assets.php.earth/docs/interop/atom.jpg "Atom Editor")

[Atom](https://atom.io) is an advanced open source text editor for developers.
This article will explain some useful packages and tricks how to make the most
out of it when developing with PHP.

## IDE or editor?

First, a bit of an introduction and comparison between IDE (integrated development
environment) and editor. IDE provides more functionality out-of-the-box compared
to an editor. So why would you want to use an editor in the first place?

Editor usually requires less computer resources and can work faster compared to
an IDE. Also the learning curve and time to get used to an editor is less steep.
And on top of that editor can still be customized with additional packages to behave
a lot like an IDE.

One of the recommended ways to develop applications is for example, to use an IDE
for developing the project at large and an editor for quick edits across different
projects or folders. However you can successfully develop PHP projects also
without an IDE. Explore and try different tools to see what suits your development
workflow. Make sure that the tools you use, make you productive.

## Atom installation

Installation of Atom is as simple as it gets and works on all widely used operating
systems (Linux, Windows and macOS). Visit the [Atom homepage](https://atom.io)
and the releases on [GitHub](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases) to download
the installation for your system.

## Themes

By default, Atom comes with multiple nice themes you can use out of the box.
Additional themes can be obtained from [Atom themes repository](https://atom.io/themes).

!["Atom Themes"](https://assets.php.earth/docs/interop/atom-themes.png "Atom Themes")

## Configuration

Nice thing about Atom is that it can be customized to do almost anything.
Configurations can be set via the menu `Edit > Preferences`.

!["Atom Preferences"](https://assets.php.earth/docs/interop/atom-preferences.png "Atom Preferences")

The configuration files are saved in your home directory `~/.atom`, so you can
backup them to your [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/) and have a portable
configured development environment for multiple development machines.

Some of the portable files in that folder are `config.cson`, `keymap.cson`,
`snippets.cson`, and `styles.less`. The installed packages can also be exported
to a custom list file via command line:

```bash
apm list --installed --bare > packages.list
```

When you will need to reinstall Atom, the saved packages list can be used to quickly
install all your favorite packages:

```bash
apm install --packages-file packages.list
```

### Code style

By default, Atom already supports syntax highlighting and snippets for a lot of
languages. For PHP it uses the [language-php](https://atom.io/packages/language-php)
package. To set your preferred coding style such as spaces/tabs, line ending, and
similar go to `Edit > Preferences > Packages` and type `language-php` and set
some default behaviors you use. In the following section we'll check some packages
that can improve and extend managing code style in your PHP project.

## Packages

Atom packages extend core editor functionality. They can be obtained from
the [Atom packages repository](https://atom.io/packages).

Packages can be installed via the GUI `Edit > Preferences > Install` or with the
command line Atom package manager [apm](https://github.com/atom/apm):

```bash
apm install package-name
```

By default, Atom provides basic editing capabilities and everything you need to
write PHP code. There are many packages to extend and make writing PHP code
more efficient and provide a much better development experience. If you are used
to some advanced IDE functionality already, you're familiar with things such as
autocompletion, code inspection, generating code snippets and more. There are
a lot of Atom packages for PHP development, however you might want to take a look
at some of the following highlighted packages for having PHP development more
efficient.

### Atom beautify

![Atom Beautify](https://assets.php.earth/docs/interop/atom-beautify.gif "Atom Beautify")

Did you get a code that is not suited for your coding style? The
[atom-beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify) package is a must check
for having a consistent code style and to beautify the code on the fly. It cleans
the code for multiple languages according to the predefined code style settings.
To successfully beautify PHP code, you must also separately install either the
[php-cs-fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer) or the
[PHP Code Sniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer).

### Editorconfig

To have a consistent code style across different editors for multiple people, you
might want to take a look at [Editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) initiative.
The [editorconfig](https://atom.io/packages/editorconfig) package adds support
for `.editorconfig` file to Atom.

### PHP Integrator

[PHP Integrator](https://php-integrator.github.io/) is a collection of multiple
Atom packages to provide a better PHP development experience. To install and
successfully use PHP Integrator packages you will first need to install some
prerequisites:

* PHP
* [php-sqlite](http://php.net/manual/en/book.sqlite.php) extension
* [php-mbstring](http://php.net/manual/en/book.mbstring.php)
* openssl
* [project-manager](https://atom.io/packages/project-manager) package
* [php-integrator-base](https://atom.io/packages/php-integrator-base) package

After base PHP Integrator installation save your PHP project in Project Manager
(`Packages > Project Manager > Save Project`) and index it with PHP integrator
(`Packages > PHP Integrator > Set Up Current Project`) which will index project
files for further usage.

PHP Integrator and [Linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter) inspect and validate
your PHP code for errors, check
[PHP DocBlocks](https://phpdoc.org/docs/latest/guides/docblocks.html) and more.

  The [php-integrator-navigation](https://atom.io/packages/php-integrator-navigation)
  package provides code navigation and go to functionality for your PHP source code.
  For example, clicking a class opens the source code file. Opening can be done by
  adjusting the settings (`Alt` + left mouse click, `Shift`+ left mouse click or
  similar).

* PHP Integrator Refactoring

  ![Atom PHP Integrator Refactoring](https://assets.php.earth/docs/interop/atom-refactoring.gif "Atom PHP Integrator Refactoring")

  The [php-integrator-refactoring](https://atom.io/packages/php-integrator-refactoring)
  package provides refactoring capabilities for your PHP source code. It generates
  getters and setters for PHP classes and similar. Keybinding: `Alt` + `Enter`.

* PHP Integrator Annotations

  ![Atom PHP Integrator Annotations](https://assets.php.earth/docs/interop/atom-annotations.png "Atom PHP Integrator Annotations")

experience and add additional functionality you might want to check these awesome
packages.

### Minimap

![Atom Minimap](https://assets.php.earth/docs/interop/atom-minimap.gif "Atom Minimap")

The [minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap) package adds file preview on the
sidebar. Once you get used to it, it is a must have package in your collection.
It is useful for easier overview of the source code and quicker navigation over
the file.

### Highlight Selected

The [highlight-selected](https://atom.io/packages/highlight-selected) package
highlights the current word selected when double clicking. If you're using the
minimap package there is also
[minimap-highlight-selected](https://atom.io/packages/minimap-highlight-selected).

### Atom Minify

The [atom-minify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-minify) package minifies JavaScript
and CSS files. It is useful when you come across a need to manually quickly minify
a required file on the fly.

### Todo Show

The [todo-show](https://atom.io/packages/todo-show) finds all `TODO`, `FIXME`,
`CHANGED` and similar comments in your project and shows them in a nice overview
list.

### Color Picker and Pigments

The [color-picker](https://atom.io/packages/color-picker) package opens color
picker for color codes such as HEX by using right click or pressing
`CMD-SHIFT-C`/`CTRL-ALT-C`. [Pigments](https://atom.io/packages/pigments) displays
colors for color codes in the editor itself.

### Ctrl-dir-scroll

The [ctrl-dir-scroll](https://atom.io/packages/ctrl-dir-scroll) package is convenient
for users who are used to shortcuts from some other IDEs and editors. By default,
Atom uses `Ctrl` and up/down keys to move the line up and down. This package adds
scrolling up and down with keyboard - `CTRL` and up/down keys.

### Project Manager

The [project-manager](https://atom.io/packages/project-manager) package helps you
manage multiple projects.

### Emmet

[Emmet](https://atom.io/packages/emmet) adds support for [Emmet](http://emmet.io/).

### Docblockr

[Docblockr](https://atom.io/packages/docblockr) is a helper package for writing
documentation.

### File Icons

The [file-icons](https://atom.io/packages/file-icons) package adds icons in tree
view for recognized file types.

### Framework specific packages

PHP frameworks are supported by multiple packages which provide additional
functionality such as code snippets.

* [CodeIgniter](https://atom.io/packages/codeigniter)
* [Drupal](https://atom.io/packages/drupal)
* [Laravel](https://atom.io/packages/laravel)
* [Symfony](https://github.com/Peekmo/atom-symfony2)
* [WordPress](https://atom.io/packages/wordpress-autocomplete/)

### Docker

Developing with different PHP installations, extensions and dependencies soon
requires virtualization and/or containerization such as Docker. Docker can be
optionally integrated in Atom with additional plugins:

* [language-docker](https://atom.io/packages/language-docker)

  Adds Dockerfile syntax highlighting.

* [docker](https://atom.io/packages/docker)

  Integrates Docker with Atom editor.

## Shortcuts and useful features

Keyboard shortcuts can make you more productive. These are some of the keyboard
shortcuts you might find useful. On Linux and Windows use the `Ctrl` key, and on
macOS the `Cmd`.

* **Comments:** `Ctrl` + `/`

  Comments/uncomments selected code.

* **Find and open a file:** `Ctrl` + `p`

* **Command Palette:** `Shift` + `Ctrl` + `p`

  Command palette simplifies access to find and run available commands instead
  of going through the menu manually.

  ![Atom Command Palette](https://assets.php.earth/docs/interop/atom-command-pallete.png "Atom Command Palette")

* **Multiple cursors:**

  With `Ctrl` and left mouse click you can add more cursors to the editor which
  behave the same as a single cursor. This is useful for changing multiple same
  values on different parts of the file.

## Caveats and final thoughts

### Performance

Having installed and enabled a lot of packages might also slightly slow down the
performance. When opening very large files (few MB), the editor performance can
decrease and the editor becomes unresponsive. Currently Atom supports files up
to few MB (~10MB), and works a bit better on Linux and macOS systems. This has
been already noted on [Atom issue tracker](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues),
so it might be fixed in the future.

How to deal with the issue of very large files (for example, log files)?

Many GUI editors and IDEs have same issues when opening and working on large files.
People usually solve this with the command line tools like `grep`, `cat`, `head`,
`tail`, and `sed`. For compressed files there are also `zless`, `zmore`, `zcat`,
and `zgrep`.

### Learning curve

At first, Atom might seem a bit overwhelming, specially to fine tune it for your
needs. So, as with every tool, take some extra time and read the
[documentation](https://atom.io/docs) to get to know it in more details.

Multiple community packages can have the same keybindings and in this case need
to be reconfigured manually.

Which packages to install and which not is your choice and preference. For PHP
development in particular, many tasks can be done by using native tools in
the command line instead of using editor plugins. For example, unit testing,
running Docker containers, deployment, running up local development server and
similar.

Atom truly is a magnificent editor worth taking a look. It has a huge community
behind and it is open sourced.
