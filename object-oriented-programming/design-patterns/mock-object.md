Mock objects imitate the behavior of the real objects. They are used in testing,
where creating mock objects makes testing simpler and still provides the same
behavior as the real object used in the application code. They can be also used
as a base while developing a specific part of an application in a team, without
utilizing the entire application.

## Implementations
