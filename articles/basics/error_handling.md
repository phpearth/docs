These are functions dealing with error handling and logging. They allow you to define your own error handling rules, as well as modify the way the errors can be logged. This allows you to change and enhance error reporting to suit your needs.

Using these logging functions, you can send messages directly to other machines, to an email, to system logs, etc., so you can selectively log and monitor the most important parts of your applications and websites.

## Installation:

The error and logging functions are part of the PHP core. There is no installation needed to use these functions.

## Runtime Configuration:

The behaviour of these functions is affected by settings in php.ini. These settings are defined below.

You can use any of the constant while configuring your php.ini file.
