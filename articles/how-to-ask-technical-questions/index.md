Before asking a colleague, friend or teammate on a forum, Facebook or Google group, email, chat or even in person
a technical/development question make sure you do some research and study your issue on your own first.

You should understand that your question might have been answered before and users that know the answer to your question
often get irritated by answering same questions or if they see you're not willing to cooperate or not trying to use internet
services such as Google by yourself.

The issue with asking questions goes also further. First language of many users is not English and questions are often asked
in poor English without any details about the issue.

Example of a poor and badly structured question:

> Plz, can you give me code for file uploading?

Better approach with this issue would be to first find examples of PHP upload library by yourself by searching on Google and making
some research about the available libraries and coding patterns needed to solve this issue and than ask specific question about
your code. This way people will see that you are trying by yourself and have made some research about uploading files with PHP:

> Hello, I'm using [fileupload library][file-upload] for uploading files in PHP but I'm receiving the following error:
> "The uploaded file exceeds the upload_max_filesize directive in php.ini".
>
> Can you please help me with some steps how to solve this or suggest me some other libraries for uploading files with PHP?

Above example is a bit dummy but you get the idea. Respect the time of other people willing to help you and also saying "Thank you"
when the solution is solved can give much better image about you and warmer feeling for helpers.

Keep learning, the expert at anything was once a beginner.
