# How to Work With Users' Passwords and How to Securely Hash Passwords in PHP?

When you must save user's password in a database you should never ever store them
in plain text because of security precautions and privacy protection. Database
where users' passwords are stored might get compromised and by hashing them at
least there is another safety mechanism for not revealing them to the attacker.

```php
<?php

// plain text password example
$password = 'secretcode';
```

Cryptography is a large and quite complex field for a lot of people so a good
rule of a thumb would be to leave it to the experts.

One of the most used but wrong way of hashing password was once using `md5()`
which calculates md5 hash of a string. Hashing passwords with md5 (or sha1
or even sha256) is note safe anymore because these hashes can get decrypted very
fast.

```php
<?php

// plain text password
$password = 'secretcode';

// hash the password with md5
$md5 = md5($password);
```

Common solution to preventing decryption is using the salt.

```php
<?php

// plain text password
$password = 'secretcode';

// add random number of random characters - the salt
$salt = '3x%%$bf83#dls2qgdf';

// hash salt and password together
$md5 = md5($salt.$password);
```

This is still not good enough though - Rainbow tables.

## Right Way of Hashing Passwords in PHP

Right way of hashing passwords is currently using latest PHP version and its
[native passwords hashing API](http://php.net/manual/en/book.password.php) which
provides an easy to use wrapper around [crypt](http://php.net/manual/en/function.crypt.php)
function.

Example of PHP native password hashing API usage:

```php
<?php

// plain text password
$password = 'secretcode';

$options = ['cost' => 12];
echo password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT, $options);
```

In `password_hash()` function there are currently two types of algorithm options
available. `PASSWORD_DEFAULT` and `PASSWORD_BCRYPT`. Currently `PASSWORD_DEFAULT`
is `PASSWORD_BCRYPT` and as language and cryptography progress there will be
different types of algorithms supported. `PASSWORD_DEFAULT` will get replaced
with that new type of algorithm (for example,
[Argon2](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/argon2_password_hash)). Good choice is to always
use the `PASSWORD_DEFAULT`.

The database password's field type should be `varchar(255)` for future proof
algorithm changes.

Using your own salt is not a very good option. Leave that to the experts as well
and use above bullet proof solution without setting your own salt. Salt is randomly
generated by default in `password_hash()` function.

Another option that is important to mention is the `cost` which controls the hash
speed. On servers with better resources `cost` can be increased. There is a script
for calculating the cost for your environment in the
[PHP manual](http://php.net/manual/en/function.password-hash.php#example-989).
As a good security practice try increasing this to higher value than the default
`10`.

Verifying passwords can be done with
[password_verify()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.password-verify.php):

```php
<?php

// this is the hash of the password in above example
$hash = '$2y$12$VD3vCfuHcxU0zcgDvArQSOlQmPv3tXW0TWoteV4QvBYL66khev0oq';

if (password_verify('secretcode', $hash)) {
    echo 'Password is valid!';
} else {
    echo 'Invalid password.';
}
```

Another useful function is
[password_needs_rehash()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.password-needs-rehash.php) - which
checks if given hash matches given options. This comes handy in case of server
hardware upgrade and therefore increasing the `cost` option.

The hash string returned by `password_hash()` consists of the following parts:

```php
$algorithm = substr($hash, 0, 4);  // $2y$ == BLOWFISH
$cost      = substr($hash, 4, 2);  // the cost
$salt      = substr($hash, 7, 22); // salt is automatically generated by default
```

## Password Hashing in Older PHP Versions (5.5 and Below)

In case you're still using some older PHP version, there is a way to secure
passwords securely. Since PHP version > 5.3.7 you can use PHP library
[password_compat](https://github.com/ircmaxell/password_compat). PHP library
`password_compat` works exactly the same way as does the native PHP password
hashing API, so when you upgrade to latest PHP you will not need to refactor your
code.

For PHP version below 5.3.6 [phpass](http://www.openwall.com/phpass/) might be a
good solution, but try to avoid these and use the native password hashing API.

## Password Hashing in Open Source Projects

Some of the widely used PHP open source projects use different hashing algorithms
for passwords because they either support older PHP versions where `password_hash()`
wasn't available yet or they already use the latest security recommendations by
PHP security experts:

Project | Password hashing
--- | ---
*CMS Airship* | Argon2i
*Drupal* | SHA512Crypt with multiple rounds
*Joomla* | bcrypt
*Laravel* | [bcrypt with other options](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/hashing)
*Symfony* | [bcrypt with other options](http://symfony.com/doc/current/security.html)
*Wordpress* | salted MD5
