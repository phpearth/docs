# Symfony framework

[Symfony](http://symfony.com) is a set of reusable PHP components and a framework.

Best way to get to know Symfony is to go through a
[quick tour](http://symfony.com/doc/current/quick_tour/index.html) - four chapters,
each 10 minutes long. After that reading the [documentation](http://symfony.com/doc/current/index.html)
is advised and best way to learn it thoroughly.

Symfony uses bundles for application and to extend and reuse functionality in
it. Large and vibrant community that evolved around Symfony provides bundles for
almost anything. They can be found at [KpnBundles](http://knpbundles.com/).

You can also get [certified](https://sensiolabs.com/en/symfony/certification.html)
or meet the community at one of the [Symfony events](http://symfony.com/events/).
