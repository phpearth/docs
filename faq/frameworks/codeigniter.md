[CodeIgniter](http://www.codeigniter.com/) is a powerful PHP framework with a
very small footprint, built for developers who need a simple and elegant toolkit
to create full-featured web applications.

CodeIgniter has a lean MVC framework, with enough capabilities to improve
productivity, while providing for third-party addons/plugins for additional
functionality.
