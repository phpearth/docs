## PHP Compared to Other Programming Languages

Completely normal question to ask yourself when starting a project is which
technology to choose.

Some of the PHP strengths:

* Good speed and performance
* Simplicity and ability to develop complex applications
* Very vibrant, large and diverse community
* Active, updated and detailed manual
* Wide selection of out-of-the-box, popular and production ready open source
  solutions such as CMSes, E-commerce, CRMs and frameworks, components and
  libraries for building applications from scratch.
* PHP is used by [82.1%](https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/programming_language/all)
  of all the websites whose server-side platform could be measured.
