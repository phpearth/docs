Knowing something about [PHP history](http://php.net/history.php) and who
initially created the PHP language and started the [PHP](http://php.net) project
is an interesting side information that might help inspire you for developing something
yourself as well. It might also help you better understand the current state of
PHP functionality.

PHP was initially written by **Rasmus Lerdorf**. It all started in 1994 when
Rasmus started working on the very first incarnation of PHP which was a simple
set of Common Gateway Interface (CGI) binaries written in the C programming
language.
