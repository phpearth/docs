One of main advantages of using PHP is its **awesome**, large and diverse community behind it. Community consists of at the same time
PHP libraries, frameworks, CMSes and other PHP applications and on the other hand great open minded people that are connected with
each other one way or the other.

## PHP UG concept

PHP User Group (PUG) is virtual or real in-place community consisting of local people participating and organizing PHP conferences and meetings. You
can find your local user group at official [PHP user groups list][php-net-ug] which is based on the [PHP.ug][php-ug]. In case there is no local
PHP User Group near you find some friends interested in PHP and start your own local usergroup.

Many organizers use also [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/) for organizing and sharing PHP meetings.
