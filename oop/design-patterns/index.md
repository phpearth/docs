* [Singleton](singleton/)

### Structural

* [Bridge](bridge/)
* [Composite](composite/)
* [Decorator](decorator/)
* [Facade](facade/)
* [Flyweight](flyweight/)
* [Proxy](proxy/)

### Behavioral

* [Command](command/)
* [Intepreter](interpreter/)
* [Iterator](iterator/)
* [Madiator](madiator/)
* [Memento](memento/)
* [Observer](observer/)
* [State](state/)
* [Strategy](strategy/)
* [Template method](template-method/)
