# SOLID

SOLID is a collection of good programming practices for object oriented
programming and consists of 6 principles. These aren't rules that you should be
following strictly everywhere. These are more like best practices you should
use when possible and understood. If there are better practices than these
found and developed at some point in the future, they too will be extended and
explained in separate chapters.

SOLID stands for:

* **S** as single responsibility principle
* **O** as open/close principle
* **L** as Liskov segregation principle
* **I** as interface segregation principle
* **D** as dependency inversion principle

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Single responsibility principle states that each class or module should have
one and only one role or responsibility.

## Open/Close Principle (OC)

Open/close principle states that each class should be open for extension and at
the same time closed for modification.

## Liskov Segregation Principle (LSP)

Liskov segregation principle states that objects should be replaceable with
instances of any of their parent classes.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Interface segregation principle states that classes should not be limited and
locked for accepting more of their kind.

## Dependency Inversion Principle

Dependency inversion principle states that classes should depend on
abstractions rather than only certain class dependencies. Abstraction should be
implemented without detailed functionality so that classes can use the
abstraction and extend it accordingly.
