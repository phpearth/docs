# What is dependency injection container in PHP?

To better understand dependency injection container, the
[dependency injection design pattern](/php/ref/oop/design-patterns/dependency-injection.md)
is a prerequisite.

Dependency injection container is very useful and recommended way of managing
class dependencies. It is a utility which helps you to implement the dependency
injection pattern in your application.

Dependency injection container is a combination of container design pattern,
factory pattern and (optionally) flyweight pattern when utilizing objects as
service descriptors. General implementations of dependency injection container
are also inspecting components (utilizing reflection).
