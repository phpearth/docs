ElePHPant is that adorable PHP mascot with an elephant in its design.

The ElePHPant logo was originally introduced and created in 1998 for the PHP
community by Vincent Pontier - spiritual father of thousands of ElePHPants
around the world. In 1998, there were mostly CGI scripts used for dynamic
websites. Vincent's friend, François Buffière, introduced him to the PHP language.
Vincent came up with the ElePHPant by drawing PHP letters on a paper and playing
with them a little. He noticed they were in shape of an elephant.

At that time in France only few sites were talking about PHP. One was Jean-Pierre
Dezelus' page and he was also a collector of elephants. He asked Vincent to make
an elephant logo for PHP with same style as the original PHP logo - a blue oval
with black outline gradient.

Then the original ElePHPant logo came to birth:

The plush animal toy - ElePHPant came to birth 10 years later.

ElePHPants are present at many PHP conferences and computers for inspiration and
fun.
